So it finally happened. Ryan snuck in under your noses and got a node project
live. l-o-l-o-l.

Ok, so before you ragequit, let me explain...

## Scope of this tiny project

To throw stuff in to slack and to catch stuff

## Installation

`npm install` should get you most of the way there.
Other than that, I'd recommend `npm install -g nodemon` so that you don't have
to restart the sever every time you make a change.

To run the project, do `nodemon index.js`
